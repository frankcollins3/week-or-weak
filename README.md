# week-or-weak
puppeteer: () => scrape github data from profile. > 20 commits for the weak? email thumbs up.

If I understand puppeteer correctly, that it is a web scraper that can grab data and possibly do so as automation, then the task is to use puppeteer to gather user-specified github data.

i'd love to see if I can link this project up to a C file of some kind and have that file prepare a linked list of struct/2d matrix array to store:

1 ) Github commit data tracked weekly. 
2 ) If there are more than 20 commits for the week, then gather user input for the email / SMS to interact with, and send an email of a thumbs up. < 20 commits email a thumbs down.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
farther reaching goal: handle gathering of email char in main.c & have JS utilize those char[] to send emails.
